 Program_Description:
 --File Name: bintree.h
 -- A program demonstrating the understanding of implmenting a Binary Search 
 	Tree This program also shows understanding of pointers, memory leaks, and 
	object references.
 
 The Running time for Program, for:
 	-- Searching: O(long(n))
 	-- inserting: O(log(n))
 	--	Reconstructing from array/binary tree: O(n)

	-> Abstract:
		This program is implemented using the NodeData class, each node within
		the tree structure is a tree node which contains a NodeData pointer.
 
 Program_Features:
 -- Defaults constructor of 1 parameter.
 -- Copy Constructor,initalizes this with a deep copy of rhs.
 -- operator=, 		assignment operator copyies(deep-copy) RHS to THIS.
 -- operator==, 	checks wether the two objects are the same.
 -- operator!=, 	check wether the two object are not the same.
 -- operator>>, 	output the current object in order traversal.
 -- insert, 		Inserts a NodeData pointer into the binary tree.
 -- isEmpty, 		checks if the Object is empty.
 --	retrieve,		searchs for specific NodeData target.
 -- bstreeToArray,	turns binary tree into an array.
 --	arrayToBstree,	turns array into binary tree.
 -- makeEmpty,		makes the object empty, deallocates all nodes
 -- displaysSideways,	displays the tree repersentation side ways.
 --	getHeight,		return the most-depth of a given NodeData.
 
 Assumptions:
 -- iostream library's are visable and included packages for
 output functionalities.
 -- NodeData is included within the program, to fufill the dependency this
 program has for NodeData.
 -- NodeData has correct implmentations of operator ==,!=, >, <, copy
 Constructor.

 |		However starting at the right side, or the right subtree, then to the
 |		left subtree. too get the tab effect printed out, we first start with
 |		zero depth, then for each recursive stack, or recursive call/ move
 |		to further to the right, we iterate our depth variable to know
 |		how much tabs we should have, once the stack call is over, that stack
 |		call will have the dept variable associated with the number or tabs
 |		we then print the number of tabs with a for-loop, in this instance
 |		we also have the current number of tabs for the left child in an
 |		event where the left chil exceeds the right, we can start for example
 |		current right child is 8 depth then the left is 9, the current stack
 |		holds a depth variable of 8, iterating the left stack call by one
 |		solves this little problem.
